- [ ] Ensure multi-tenant API mocking supports all industry contexts (Cinema, Hotel, Gym, B2B, Retail)
- [ ] All MSW-dependent tests pass without import/syntax errors

**Priority**: Critical
**Effort Estimate**: Medium (M)
**Business Value**: High - Enables all API-dependent tests to function properly

**Technical Notes**:
- Update `src/__tests__/mocks/handlers.ts` to use MSW v2 `http` API
