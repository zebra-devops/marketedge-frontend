# Issue #17 (US-202): Multi-Tenant Organization Switching - Detailed User Story

## Epic Context

**Strategic Objective:** Enable seamless multi-tenant organization switching for Super Admins managing multiple client organizations (Odeon cinema + other clients)

**Market Validation:** Multi-tenant SaaS platforms require efficient organization context switching to manage diverse client bases across different industries

**Success Metrics:** 
- Organization switching time < 2 seconds
- Zero cross-tenant data leakage incidents
- User session maintained across organization switches
- Audit trail complete for all switching events

**Cross-Industry Insights:** Organization switching patterns consistent across cinema (Odeon), hotel, gym, B2B, and retail clients - all require strict tenant isolation

## User Story

As a **Super Admin managing multiple client organizations**, I want to **seamlessly switch between different client organizations (Odeon cinema, hotels, gyms, etc.)** so that **I can manage multiple tenants efficiently while maintaining strict data isolation and security boundaries**.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Core Functionality
- [ ] Organization switcher component integrated in main navigation header
- [ ] Dropdown displays all accessible organizations with industry badges (cinema, hotel, gym, etc.)
- [ ] Current organization clearly indicated with visual distinction
- [ ] Organization switch completes within 2 seconds maximum
- [ ] Navigation state preserved during organization switching
- [ ] User remains on same page after organization switch (when possible)

### Data Isolation & Security
- [ ] Complete data isolation validated between tenants (Odeon vs other clients)
- [ ] User permissions recalculated after organization switch
- [ ] Organization context properly maintained throughout entire application
- [ ] API calls include correct organization context headers
- [ ] No cross-tenant data leakage through organization switching
- [ ] Session security maintained during organization context changes

### User Experience
- [ ] Loading states during organization switching with progress indicators
- [ ] Error handling for failed organization switches with user-friendly messages
- [ ] Graceful fallback when user loses access to previously selected organization
- [ ] Visual feedback confirming successful organization switch
- [ ] Industry-specific icons and colors for different organization types

### Technical Requirements
- [ ] Organization context persisted in browser session/localStorage
- [ ] Audit logging for all organization switching events
- [ ] Performance optimized for users with access to 10+ organizations
- [ ] Mobile-responsive organization switcher interface
- [ ] Keyboard navigation support for accessibility

## Market Research Integration

**Competitive Analysis:** Leading multi-tenant platforms (Salesforce, Microsoft, AWS) use consistent organization switching patterns with:
- Header-based organization selectors
- Visual distinction for current context
- Fast switching without page reloads
- Clear industry/tenant identification

**Client Validation:** Pseudo-client perspective confirms need for:
- Quick organization identification (industry badges essential)
- Efficient switching for managing multiple cinema chains
- Clear visual feedback during switching process
- Audit trails for compliance and security

**Market Opportunity:** Organization switching efficiency directly impacts platform adoption for enterprise clients managing multiple locations/subsidiaries

## Technical Considerations

**Platform Impact:** 
- Frontend: Integration of existing `OrganizationSwitcher.tsx` component into `DashboardLayout.tsx`
- Backend: Organization switching API endpoints with proper authentication
- Database: Tenant isolation validation through existing RLS policies

**Performance Notes:** 
- Organization list cached for fast dropdown rendering
- Context switching optimized to avoid unnecessary API calls
- Background validation of organization permissions

**Security Requirements:**
- JWT token validation for organization access rights
- Audit logging of all organization switching events
- Cross-tenant data leakage prevention validation
- Session hijacking protection during context switching

**Integration Impact:**
- All existing components must respect organization context
- Market Edge, Causal Edge, Value Edge tools scoped to organization
- User permissions refreshed after organization switch

**ps Validation Needed:** Yes - Client perspective validation on organization switching UX patterns and industry identification requirements

**Technical Escalation Needed:** No - Implementation using existing technical patterns and components

## Definition of Done

- Market intelligence integrated (competitive analysis on organization switching patterns complete)
- Strategic objectives validated (multi-tenant platform foundation established)
- Client perspective validated (pseudo-client review confirms UX requirements)
- Technical feasibility confirmed (existing components and infrastructure support implementation)
- Multi-tenant compliance verified (tenant isolation maintained throughout switching process)
- Performance implications assessed (organization switching performance benchmarks met)
- Security requirements validated (audit logging and cross-tenant protection implemented)
- Ready for qa-orch coordination (GitHub issue creation and development workflow initiation)

## Implementation Dependencies

**Existing Components Available:**
- `OrganizationSwitcher.tsx` - Organization switching UI component
- `OrganisationProvider.tsx` - Organization context management
- Multi-tenant database with RLS policies

**Required API Endpoints:**
- `GET /api/organizations/accessible` - Get user's accessible organizations
- `POST /api/organizations/{id}/switch` - Switch organization context
- `GET /api/organizations/{id}/validate` - Validate organization access

**Integration Points:**
- `DashboardLayout.tsx` - Header integration point
- All page components - Organization context awareness
- API service layer - Organization context headers

## Validation Checklist

**Multi-Tenant Security:**
- [ ] No cross-tenant data visible during organization switching
- [ ] User permissions properly scoped to selected organization
- [ ] Audit trail captures all organization switching events
- [ ] Session security maintained throughout switching process

**User Experience Quality:**
- [ ] Professional UI matching existing platform standards
- [ ] Fast, responsive organization switching (< 2 seconds)
- [ ] Clear visual feedback and error handling
- [ ] Mobile-responsive and accessible interface

**Technical Implementation:**
- [ ] Integration with existing authentication system
- [ ] Proper error handling and fallback mechanisms
- [ ] Performance optimized for multiple organization scenarios
- [ ] Code quality meets platform development standards
