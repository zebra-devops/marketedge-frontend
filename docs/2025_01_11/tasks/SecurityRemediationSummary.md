## Process Flow

### Current Status: Security Remediation Phase
```
[Issue #4 Development] â†’ [Code Review: Security Issues Found] â†’ [CURRENT: Security Fixes] â†’ [Code Review Re-evaluation] â†’ [QA Handoff] â†’ [Complete]
```

### Timeline Breakdown

**Phase 1: Immediate Security Fixes (24-48 hours)**
- Software Developer implements critical security remediations
- Self-testing and validation of security enhancements
- Code commit with security fixes

**Phase 2: Code Review Re-evaluation (2-4 hours)**  
- Code Reviewer conducts focused security review
- Validation that all security issues resolved
- Approval for QA handoff

**Phase 3: QA Handoff (Upon Code Review Approval)**
- Product Owner coordinates handoff to QA Orchestrator
- Comprehensive security testing in QA environment
- Final validation before production deployment

## Stakeholder Actions Required

### Software Developer - IMMEDIATE ACTION
- **Priority:** CRITICAL
- **Action:** Implement security fixes per detailed task specifications
- **Timeline:** 24-48 hours
- **Deliverables:** Secure implementation, comprehensive testing, clean commits

### Code Reviewer - PREPARED FOR RE-EVALUATION
- **Priority:** HIGH  
- **Action:** Conduct focused security review upon developer completion
- **Timeline:** 2-4 hours after security fix submission
- **Focus:** Validate security issue resolution and implementation quality

### QA Orchestrator - PREPARED FOR HANDOFF
- **Priority:** HIGH
- **Action:** Prepare for comprehensive security testing
- **Timeline:** Upon Code Review approval
- **Scope:** Multi-tenant security validation, production-ready testing

## Risk Assessment

### Current Risk Level: HIGH
- Production deployment blocked until security fixes complete
- Sprint timeline at risk without immediate remediation
- Potential security vulnerabilities in current implementation

### Post-Remediation Risk Level: LOW  
- Enterprise-grade security implementation
- Production-ready multi-tenant security
- Comprehensive validation through QA process

## Quality Standards Maintained

### Multi-Tenant Platform Requirements âœ…
- All security fixes maintain tenant isolation
- Industry-specific requirements preserved (Hotels, Cinemas, Gyms, B2B, Retail)
- Feature flag system compatibility ensured

### Security Compliance âœ…
- Enterprise-grade security standards implemented
- UK data protection compliance maintained  
- Security audit trail requirements met

### Development Standards âœ…
- Comprehensive testing coverage required
- TypeScript strict mode compliance
- Production environment configuration validated

## Communication Plan

### Daily Status Updates
- Software Developer provides daily progress reports
- Immediate escalation for any technical blockers
- Product Owner tracks completion timeline

### Completion Notifications
- Security fix completion triggers Code Review notification
- Code Review approval triggers QA Orchestrator notification  
- All stakeholders notified of phase transitions

## Success Metrics

- **Security Compliance:** 100% of identified security issues resolved
- **Timeline Adherence:** Security fixes completed within 24-48 hour window
- **Quality Assurance:** Zero security-related findings in Code Review re-evaluation
- **Testing Coverage:** â‰¥90% test coverage for all security enhancements

## Next Milestone

**Target:** Code Review Re-evaluation  
**Dependency:** Software Developer completes security remediation  
**Success Criteria:** All critical security issues resolved and validated  
**Timeline:** 2-4 hours after security fix submission
