**Sprint:** Week 1 - Platform Foundation  
**Status:** Timeline Revision Required  

## Executive Summary

QA testing has identified critical production blockers in the authentication system (Issue #4) that require immediate remediation. While the security architecture foundation is solid, infrastructure issues create unacceptable production risks.

**Impact:** 6-10 day delay from original Week 1 timeline  
**Priority:** P0-Critical issues require immediate development focus  

## Current Sprint Status

### Issue #4: Auth0 Integration (BLOCKED)
**Status:** ðŸ”´ Critical Production Blockers Identified  
**Production Readiness:** 30/100 - Unacceptable  
**Timeline Impact:** 6-10 day delay  

**Critical Blockers:**
- Database connectivity failure preventing multi-tenant isolation validation
- Frontend test infrastructure breakdown blocking security test execution
- User role model inconsistencies blocking authorization testing
- Input validation pattern issues creating security gaps

### Issue #2: Organization Management (READY FOR PARALLEL)
**Status:** ðŸŸ¡ Available for Parallel Work  
**Dependency:** Can proceed if development capacity allows  
**Risk:** Some integration testing delayed pending Issue #4 resolution  

### Quality Standards Maintained
- 100% security test pass rate requirement upheld
- Multi-tenant isolation validation standards maintained
- Production deployment criteria remain stringent

## Development Team Coordination

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Developer Assignment:** Issue #4 P0-Critical blockers (immediate)
2. **Resource Assessment:** Evaluate capacity for Issue #2 parallel work
3. **Timeline Planning:** Revised delivery estimates with QA re-testing window

### Work Prioritization
**Primary Focus:** Issue #4 infrastructure and security fixes
**Secondary:** Issue #2 parallel development if capacity exists
**Quality Gate:** All P0-Critical issues resolved before production consideration
